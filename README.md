# eth-crypto-zombies

This is the result of the cryptozombies.io tutorial for learning Ethereum.

My zombielink is : https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/1/share/Ndrslmpk

Primarily this project is being done, to firstly understand the syntactics of Solidity and the process of shaping new applications within Web3. At the time of this commit I mainly want to better understand how the deployment and migration of Smart Contracts work and furthermore how to efficiently connect a frontend to Ethereum. Further topics such as a selection of relevant frontend libaries and frameworks, as well as the design of an oracle will all be steps that going to be mentioned later.

To sum up, all of the work being done here are going to contribute to my bachelor thesis:

Towards financial inclusion: Leveraging the power of Decentralized Trade Finance on the example of an ethereum-based Letter of Credit prototype

Thanks to everybody wanting to contribute to my work or giving me advice for certain programming habits.

Looking forward hearing from you!
